# RuneDump
The goal of RuneDump is to act as an personal, yet efficient League of Legends Rune Manager.
Users export Runes from the League of Legends Client to RuneDump for fast importing in the future.

# The Problems
- Many players enjoy trying new characters, testing new builds, and maining (hopefully not) more than 3 champions.
- League of Legends only provides players with three free rune pages as default. 
- Additional rune pages cost 6300 Blue Essance and can take months of grinding.
- League Client is Spaguetti Code and Creating/Updating runes on the fly feels clunky, frustrating, and inefficient.
- Classic League of Legends rune assistors focus on meta builds and lack the creative, troll, and for-fun builds that you want to play on a whim.
- Classic League of Legends rune assistors seemingly import runes at random times and can really screw you over before a game.

# The Solution
RuneDump is an unbloated piece of software that is ran alongside the League Client. It saves the runes you create which can be reimported whenever you feel like it. This allows you to have more time in deciding the champion and build you want to play during champ select. The software is also active in champ select so you do not have to fiddle around with poopoo client before your game.

# System Requirements
